# AzureBasicVMOperations
This collection of scripts using  Powershell and AzureRM to provide simple means for managing VM via deployment,encrypting , 
adding to backup rotation , restoring, and other functuons.   They were  created in part to help jump start presence in cloud 
and expose powershell initiates to AzureRM cmdlets by using Out-GridView method.
I take no responsibility for use of these scripts.
